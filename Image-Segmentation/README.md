# Image Segmentation
Binary Image segmentation is the process of classifying the pixels of an image into two categories: pixels
belonging to the foreground objects of an image and pixels belonging to the background objects of an image. 

The algorithms used are :
- Ford-Fulkerson
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search

## Demo:
The program takes an input image and a configuration file that provides the initial set of foreground and
background points and creates an output file. The output file has foreground in white and background in black. Following are some examples:
